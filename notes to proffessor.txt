Hello professor,

Thanks for such an amazing course, I really enjoyed the contents of it and your delivery. It was a great pleasure to return back to my software development routes and refresh my coding knowledge.
I wish we could have you here in Kazakhstan to conduct this course on campus. 

This submission contains one jupyter notebook per section. All the sections except the last two have separate code blocks for their parts, and the last two I decided to write in one block since it seemed awkward to bring out the data split and training to a different block of code when in fact it all can go in one run. Also you can find my portfolio in .docx format in this archive as well. 

I have also published this archive into GitHub as an open source repo. However I did it in the end, so sadly there is no chronology of changes I made throughout this journey. You can find it on https://github.com/laqube/emem539_bigdata.

Wish you all the best, have a great upcoming new year and Christmas!
